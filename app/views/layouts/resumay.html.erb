                In the design and development of a new cloud-gaming service, I served as the DevOps engineer
                primarily responsible for management views and alerts.  The service is scalable from hundreds
                of simultaneous users to many thousands, and gives us same-minute visibility of actionable
                service issues, with informative alert emails containing links to relevant logs and a
                management web site that ties together the views of our custom hardware and shows its
                real-time status as well as historical performance data.  I added the management pages to our
                Ruby/Rails web site, wrote servlets for an additional Jersey server with a REST API, used
                linux servers running first CentOS and later Ubuntu, automated package installations with
                Chef, collected and indexed logs with logstash and viewed them with elasticsearch and kibana
                – these are all examples of some of the open source software that I first evaluated and then
                integrated into the system.  Testing during development was key, because only by having a
                robust set of test data could all the new functionality be developed and proven.  Unit tests
                are run automatically (by Jenkins) at the end of the build process (kicked off by source code
                changes when received at the GitHub repository), and some of the integration tests were
                reusable as runtime monitoring scripts, and were added to the alerting system either as
                icinga/nagios plugins or by running them from cron and directing their output into the
                monitored logs (rsyslog).  Programming languages used include Java, Python, Ruby,
                javascript/jQuery, and unix scripting – bash, korn.  Development environments were primarily
                IntelliJ or command-line vi, on Mac (Lion), Windows 7, and linux hosts.  Version control was
                first subversion, later git.  Issue tracking and Agile environment – JIRA/Greenhopper.

                As a developer on the DCGS v3.1 multifunction workstation (MFWS) program,
                provide new features across several areas of the Viper framework application in
                an Agile development environment. Object-oriented development is primarily done
                in C# in Visual Studio 2010 (.NET 4.0 Framework) under ClearCase source control.
                User interfaces were designed with a Model-view-controller (MVC) architecture
                using either WinForms or the WPF. The underlying database was SQL Server 2005
                and unit tests used Rhino-Mocks to interface to assemblies that were not actually
                present on the development platform. Led a team of four developers in a
                difficult migration of the internal security service from an outdated C++
                Windows Service to a managed C# WCF service. As an individual contributor, a few
                of the new features that I added were: integration with the Jericho user
                authentication and authorization API to their EnterSpace product; conversion
                from an enumerated single-value security classification to a CAPCO-compliant
                security marking for entities in the system; ability to export alias lists along
                with the entities that use those aliases; addition of timezones to dates
                imported into the system from either Analyst’s Notebook or Excel. When not
                working a new feature I did problem resolution in any of several areas across
                the application, documented and tracked with ClearQuest. Much of the work needed
                was in the areas of MTF messages and XML interoperation with the ACE system.
                Made multiple trips to the CTSF at Fort Hood, TX and the System Integration
                Laboratory (SIL) at Ft. Monmouth, NJ to support OWS interoperability test
                events. On my own initiative, developed a WinForms client adapter that uses
                reflection to instantly serialize and display the fields of any currently
                selected entity in the system, in an XML format. This visualization provides a
                valuable tool for quick analysis of entity to database alignment, and
                facilitates the design of new interoperability solutions.

                                new architecture, thereby providing an upgrade path for trainer clients that was
                                not previously possible; automated (via UNIX scripting) a procedural task that

                Object-oriented software development and
                software engineering using Java, C, C++ and AIE for applications on UNIX and
                Windows operating systems.  Performed UNIX system administration and network
                support as needed.  Provided the division manager with technical input related
                to proposals, statements of work, schedules, and capabilities. Provided guidance
                and training to the technical staff.  Added new functionality to the IEW
                Synchronization Matrix (ISM), a graphical C4I software application which
                provides a visualization of various battlefield operating systems entities and
                their relationships to each other in time and space. The ISM incorporates
                several aspects of Collection Management, Requirements Definition, and Asset
                Management. This application was originally done solely for the Army in AIE and
                C, later expanded to all branches of the military and converted to Java for more
                flexibility and platform independence.  Led the conversion to Java (an effort
                that lasted one year and involved six other developers), and wrote an AIE to
                Java translator (in Java) that was central to the conversion. The conversion to
                Java was an initial step towards integrating into the JCMT workstation; had
                previously integrated the AIE version into ASAS RWS.

                establish a southern Arizona branch for Paranet, a Houston-based company that
                provided a wide variety of technical expertise for customers that need to
                outsource some or all of their information systems requirements. Customer sites
                worked: Burr-Brown, Motorola, Charles Schwab, Hughes, Allied Signal, Southwest
                Gas, University of Arizona, Intuit. Tasks included UNIX system and network

                and lasted anywhere from a few hours to several months at any given site. Worked
                alone in most cases, but occasionally participated as part of a team of 3 to 10

                Started with calibration and repair of general-purpose test equipment, then
                quickly learned the HP instrument control programming language (RMB), and began

                software release process, purchase requests, and engineering problem reports.
                Completed all programming work, including documentation and training, for the
