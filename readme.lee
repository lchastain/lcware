Common development operations:

Upload to heroku (lcware.herokuapp.com):
-------------------------------------------
0.  Update git, both local and at gitHub  (git push)
1.  git push heroku master
2.  heroku run rake db:migrate


To get the initial 'projects' pages, did: 
  rails generate scaffold projects ... (find correct syntax in the tutorial)
  The command included the definition of two table columns.

What was done to add twitter bootstrap -
At the rails root, two command-lines:
------------------------------------------
gem install twitter-bootstrap-rails
rails generate bootstrap:install static

And it appeared to work, to activate/style the nav bar.
But other things, such as the 'accordion' - not so much.
So - downloaded a 'dist' version, unzipped it and manually put into
place the Fonts, two .css files and the bootstrap.js file which
is the same name as the one that continues on with '.coffee' but
that one is just a two-liner.  So - not confident that I don't
have some kind of 'munged' installation, and it is not working
correctly (yet?) but the additions definitely had effects.
